                If you are going to be a beekeeper, you are going to get
                stung; it is not a matter of if but when. You can greatly
                reduce your chances of getting stung by working smart and
                wearing the protective gear mentioned above. In time, you
                will learn the triggers that set off YOUR bees; not all
                triggers affect all bees in the same way and those triggers
                may only cause defensive behavior at certain times of the
                year. Keep note of when the bees seem to be reacting
                defensively and what you are doing, the weather, honey
                flows currently happening etc. and learn from these notes
                (mental or written).

                So, when the inevitable happens, what do you do and what are
                the normal symptoms of a sting versus the symptoms of an
                allergic reaction? Read on!

                Removing the Stinger - recent research indicates that you
                should remove the stinger from your skin as soon as possible;
                in the past, it has been recommended that you use an edged
                object to avoid pinching the venom sack and thereby force
                more venom into your system. Either way, get the stinger out
                of your skin ASAP! This will reduce the amount of venom
                injected into your system and will help speed your recovery.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Types of Reactions to Stings - read and understand these
                symptoms BEFORE working your bees; memorize them so you know
                when you might be in trouble.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Normal - localized pain, minor swelling, a weal (raised red
                area with a white center), itching all of which should diminsh
                and generally go away within hours or at most a few days.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Large Local - this starts similar to a normal reaction but
                after 24-48 hours the swelling can spread over an extensive
                area, sometimes the entire extremity (whole arm, leg, face
                etc.). This type of reaction can be quite painful due to the
                swelling and the itching can become unbearable; usually this
                type of reaction can take anywhere from 4-7 days to resolve
                itself. Treat with antihistamines and ice packs.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Systemic Allergic - this is the bad one. Hives, angioedema
                (massive facial swelling), a metallic taste in the mouth,
                nasuea, vomitting, diarerhea, abdominal cramps, light-headedness,
                diziness, fainting, and tremors. If you or someone you know,
                experiences these symptons IMMEDIATLEY call for an ambulance.
                Fortunatley, a truly severe reaction occurs in less than 1% of
                the population.

                Treatments for Stings - everyone has heard of at least one way
                to help reduce the swelling and pain of a bee sting. Some of
                the best are antihistamines (such as Benadryl) and ice. Others
                are vinegar, meat tenderizer paste, and calamine lotions.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Epi Pens - are prescription items that contain a dose of
                adreniline to overcome the allergic reaction to a sting so that
                the "victim" can seek medical attention. Some sources will
                recommend that as a beekeeper, you carry an epi pen. However,
                they are expensive, require a prescription (more expense) and
                expire quickly (typically only good for a year) so that the
                carrying of one "just in case" can be quite expensive if you are
                not allergic.
