## Welcome to UCBA!

This site is designed for members of the Utah County Beekeepers Association, and anyone looking for information about bees. Visit the site [by clicking here](https://www.utahcountybeekeepers.com/)

It was created by a small team of designers and developers who graduated from V School in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was built using Gatsby JS(React).

If you're not sure where to start, may we suggest the Fun Facts page (in the Education section)? 

We've enjoyed this chance to learn more about React, agile teamwork, and honeybees! 

We're glad you're here! Enjoy UCBA's new website!
